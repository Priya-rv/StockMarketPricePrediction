# StockMarketPricePrediction
I applied k-nearest neighbor algorithm to predict Stock Market Price Prediction,kNN is a instance-based, competitive learning, and lazy learning algorithm. Instance based algorithms, sometimes called memorybased learning, are those algorithms that, instead of performing explicit generalization, use the instances seen in the training as a comparison standard. For kNN, the entire training dataset is the model. When a prediction is required for a unseen data instance, the kNN algorithm will search through the training dataset for the k-most similar instance
